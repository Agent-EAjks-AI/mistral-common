# Examples

We have a few examples of how to use the library with our models:

- Use Codestral to handle FIM requests: [FIM example](./codestral_fim.md). Note that this model is also capable to handle chat completion requests.
- Use Mistral Small 3.1 to handle multimodal chat completion requests: [Chat Completion example](./small_3.1_chat_completion.md)
